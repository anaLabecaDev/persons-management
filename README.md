# Persons management ðŸ‘¥

The project goal is to manage persons information that are coming from pipedrive API and allow users to see a list of persons, filter de the list by query string, add and remove persons and to see person detailed information.

# Project set up 

For security reasons and to avoid exposing sensitive data, the API_KEY and API_DOMAIN are set in a `.env` file, so to run the project locally you have to create the `.env` file and set the values as follows: 

```bash
REACT_APP_API_KEY = 'PIPEDRIVE_API_KEY'
REACT_APP_API_DOMAIN = 'PIPEDRIVE_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN'
```

## Run locally 

1. Clone repo to local machine 
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm run install` to install dependencies
3. Create `.env` file on the root folder and add values for API_KEY and API_DOMAIN

# Implementation Comments

Since I couldn't find the exact icons used in the provided mock ups I'm using the Material Design icons available in the `react-icons` lib. 

I was not able to inspect the mock ups, that for all UI it's an eye approximation of the designs in the provided pdf file.

This are the keys generated for the custom fields (`groups` and `assistant`) and they are unique to my pipedrive account/domain.

```typescript
 '73d17c3f4d3c8a3856179466873d81a19b931b68'?: string;
  a4329aa33eb3484ce969c8ea9955d7c6a3d2b954?: string;
```

In a production env we would implement the authO flow, preventing the creation of the `.env` file 
### Improvements
- Better abstraction for axios and react query fetch 
- Move personsList and search queries to the `queries.ts` file and create custom hooks for the queries to keep all usages of one query key (like the Add and Delete) in one file, which will also make the query more easily reusable and avoid the need to pass some query related props to children components.
- Use React router to handle routes and that way when modal is opened a query string is added to the app url, which will also prevent the need of the setState to store selected personID. 
- Change pagination strategy to be a infinity scroll 
    - Use InterceptorAPI to get when last object is on screen to trigger nextPage 
    - Use react query useInfinityQuery 
    - Use React Virtual library to virtualize list 
- Validate phone number format before enabling the add person API call
- Handle errors
- Take advantage of React query to do optimist updates, then list will be updated (without a need of a refech) when Adding or deleting a person
- I've started the set up of the tests, but didn't have time to finish so:
  - Finish test configuration to mock API requests and be able to test components with data
  - Write tests for, list, search, add and delete flows
