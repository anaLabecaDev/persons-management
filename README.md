# Persons management ðŸ‘¥

The project goal is to manage persons information that are coming from pipedrive API and allow users to see a list of persons, filter de the list by query string, add and remove persons and to see person detailed information. 

# Project set up 

For security reasons and to avoid exposing sensitive data, the API_KEY and API_DOMAIN are set in a `.env` file, so to run the project locally you have to create the `.env` file and set the values as follows: 

```bash
REACT_APP_API_KEY = 'PIPEDRIVE_API_KEY'
REACT_APP_API_DOMAIN = 'PIPEDRIVE_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN'
```

Since I couldn't find the exact icons used in the provided mock ups I'm using the Material Design icons available in the `react-icons` lib. 

Since I was not able to inspect the mock ups all UI it's an eye approximation of the provided designs.
